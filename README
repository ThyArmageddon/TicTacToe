                                    How To Play


  Choose your best move by placing a stone in an empty cell. The correct cell coordinates
  are choosen by choosing an appropriate row and an appropriate collumn numbers that are
  distributed on the game field as follows:

                               Collum
                            1     2     3
                       1       |     |     
                          -----+-----+-----
                   Row 2       |     |     
                          -----+-----+-----
                       3       |     |     


  Procceed now by placing your numbers as follows: <row> <collumn> (without including the quotes)
  so for example if you choose the cell 1,1 (the top left cell at the corner) you place them
  in the input line as follows: 1 1

  This will continue untill the all the game cells are filled, then the game winner will be diplayed.

  After the game is ended, you can always replay the game by answering a simple yes/no question.


  Goodluck!
