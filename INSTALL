                                  HOW TO BUILD

   As TicTacToe is a simple CLI application, and doesn't require a ./configure
   skript, it can be easily installed by typing 'make' in the $ROOT directory
   of this source code.

   In order to uninstall this application, it's by typing 'make clean' in the
   same $ROOT directory mentioned above.
