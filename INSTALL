                                  HOW TO BUILD

   TicTacToe uses GNU autoconfigure scripts to make this easier.

     1. Type './configure' from the TicTacToe directory. The configure script
        will determine how your system is set up and figure out how to
        correctly compile TicTacToe. In TicTacToe, the paths are now handled
        with the --prefix option to configure, not in config.h.

     2. Type 'make' from the TicTacToe directory to build the source.

     3. TicTacToe must be installed in a directory somewhere. This is
        accomplished by entering 'make install' command. This will install
        TicTacToe in the specified directory.

     4. Smile, and if you haven't already read the README file in its
        entirety, go take a long walk off a short pier.
